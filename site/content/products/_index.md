        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We believe in providing comprehensive speech therapy at our clients’
    convenience. 


    A client’s home provides a more conducive environment for learning of new
    skills and/or generalization of new skills learnt into real life situations.
    Not forgetting, the home provides the most naturalistic environment to
    observe interaction between the client and their caregivers.


    We understand the needs and challenges of being a caregiver. Most caregivers
    are working thus sending your love one to the clinic for an appointment
    often result in taking leave or time off from work. This adds unnecessary
    stress to caregivers as not all employers will be as understanding towards
    the needs of being a caregiver. 


    Some clients require intensive therapy sessions to optimize treatment
    results. However, frequent travelling to the clinic can be tiring for both
    the client and their caregiver(s).


    With the advancement of technology, we can instantly turn every home into a
    computerized speech and swallowing gym to carry out intensive speech and/or
    swallowing therapy. As such, we can bring the clinic to the clients' home!

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
