        ***Swallowing***


        Assessment


        Our assessments aim to identify the causes of the swallowing problem.
        Only when the causes are identified can accurate diagnosis be made which
        will then lead to better treatment outcome. Assessments will include one
        or more of the following:-


        Clinical Bedside Evaluation

        Videofluoroscopy (X-ray of Swallowing)

        Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES)



        Treatment


        Treatment will be specific in targeting the underlying cause/s of the
        swallowing problem. There is no one ultimate treatment or solution in
        treating swallowing difficulties. Our treatment may include a
        combination of the following approaches:-


        Computerized swallowing therapy (sEMG Biofeedback Assisted Therapy)

        VitalStim Therapy

        Specific swallowing exercises targeting specific swallowing problems

        Prosthetic management

        ***Language Disorder***


        Assessment


        We will conduct thorough assessments on all the language components
        (which include comprehension, expression (speech), reading and writing)
        and identify levels of breakdown in the language system.

                                                                                                                        

        Treatment


        We will target treatment on the identified impaired language components
        and the levels of breakdown. Compensatory strategies will be taught to
        the client/caregivers to ensure some form of communication is maintained
        and encouraged. As our treatment is home based, it makes it easier to
        facilitate and understand the communication needs of our clients and
        their caregivers.

        ***Speech Difficulties***

        Assessment 


        There are many types of dysarthria which often time may be misperceived
        as apraxia of speech. A thorough assessment is needed to accurately
        diagnose the problem. Our assessment will take into account the
        underlying medical diagnosis and thorough evaluation of the 5 main
        components of speech production which include breathing, voicing,
        articulation, nasality and speech quality.


         Treatment

        We treat motor speech disorders according to the types that it is
        presented as this will ensure better treatment outcome bearing in mind
        that there are specific exercises for each type of the motor speech
        disorders. Treatment may include one or a combination of the following
        approaches:

         

        PROMPT for dyspraxia

        Lee Silverman Voice Therapy

        Specific therapy exercises for specific types of motor speech disorders

        Compensatory strategies to improve on speech productions (This is often
        time useful especially when muscles are still weak and still undergoing
        therapy)

        Prosthetic management

        Augmentative and Alternative Communication

        ***Stuttering***


        Assessment


        We will conduct thorough assessments on speech production across
        different situations taking note of the percentage and type of stutters
        produced as well as how stuttering is affecting and impacting on
        day-to-day life.

        Treatment will focus on how to control stuttering which may include
        changing the way speech is produced but keeping it as natural sounding
        as possible across different speaking situations. We believe ultimately
        that the main therapy aim is working towards more effective
        communication thus lessening the impact of stuttering when it occurs
        during interaction with others on a day-to-day basis. As our therapy is
        not clinic based, we are able to carry over and generalize techniques
        learnt into real life scenarios and situations “right there and then”.

        ***Voice Disorders***


        Assessment


        We will conduct thorough assessments on voice production components to
        rule out the cause of the voice problems. A referral to the ENT doctor
        will be made if necessary.

  heading: What we offer
  description: >-
    We believe in providing comprehensive speech therapy at our clients’
    convenience. 


    A client’s home provides a more conducive environment for learning of new
    skills and/or generalization of new skills learnt into real life situations.
    Not forgetting, the home provides the most naturalistic environment to
    observe interaction between the client and their caregivers.


    We understand the needs and challenges of being a caregiver. Most caregivers
    are working thus sending your love one to the clinic for an appointment
    often result in taking leave or time off from work. This adds unnecessary
    stress to caregivers as not all employers will be as understanding towards
    the needs of being a caregiver. 


    Some clients require intensive therapy sessions to optimize treatment
    results. However, frequent travelling to the clinic can be tiring for both
    the client and their caregiver(s).


    With the advancement of technology, we can instantly turn every home into a
    computerized speech and swallowing gym to carry out intensive speech and/or
    swallowing therapy. As such, we can bring the clinic to the clients' home!

  heading: Children Speech Therapy Services
  description: >-
    We offer assessment and therapy services for children who present with
    speech, language and/or communication difficulties that may be due to the
    following causes:-


    Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder

    Articulation and Phonological Disorders 

    Auditory Processing Disorders

    Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) / Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD)

    Childhood Stuttering

    Developmental Apraxia of Speech

    Global Developmental Delay

    Hearing Loss

    Language Delay (“Late bloomers”)

    Specific Language Impairment
     

    Assessment


    A typical assessment session generally takes about an hour to complete and
    may include the administration of a standardized test, clinical observation
    during free/structured play, and interview or questionnaire with the parent
    or caregiver. The 3 main areas to be assessed will include speech, language
    (comprehension and expression), and communication.


    Assessment findings will help us to identify the problem, if one is present,
    and determine the child’s current developmental age of function as well as
    the severity and nature of the deficit. Appropriate recommendations can then
    be made with regard to suitability of therapy, type of therapy approaches,
    specific therapy goals as well as frequency and length of treatment.

     

    Therapy


    Therapy sessions generally last for 45 minutes to 1 hour in length,
    depending on the age of the child and nature of the

    speech and/or language difficulties. And because we are providing therapy in
    an environment familiar to the child, new skills taught can be put to real
    life practice almost immediately by enacting daily routines or play with
    toys and games that is of interest to the child.


    We are able to provide the following specialized treatment approaches:-


    Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS)

    Hanen Programme – It Takes Two to Talk & More Than Words

    PROMPT Technique (Introductory Level)

    Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship-based (DIR®/Floortime™)
