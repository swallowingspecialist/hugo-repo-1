      Assessment

      Our assessments aim to identify the causes of the swallowing problem. Only
      when the causes are identified can accurate diagnosis be made which will
      then lead to better treatment outcome. Assessments will include one or
      more of the following:-

      Clinical Bedside Evaluation

      Videofluoroscopy (X-ray of Swallowing)

      Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES)


      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      Treatment will be specific in targeting the underlying cause/s of the
      swallowing problem. There is no one ultimate treatment or solution in
      treating swallowing difficulties. Our treatment may include a combination
      of the following approaches:-

      Computerized swallowing therapy (sEMG Biofeedback Assisted Therapy)

      VitalStim Therapy

      Specific swallowing exercises targeting specific swallowing problems

      Prosthetic management
