    Speech Therapy Works is a community-based private practice serving clients
    across all ages especially families or individuals who have difficulty
    receiving therapy, or would benefit from having the therapist come to them.


    We aim to be the leading home based speech therapy provider offering
    high-quality personalized speech therapy to our clients in the comfort of
    their own homes.


    Our vast experience in both the private and public healthcare sector allows
    us to have a better understanding of Singapore’s overall healthcare system.


    We are able to reach out to the community across different language and
    dialect groups as we are proficient in English, Malay, Mandarin, Cantonese,
    Hokkien and Hainanese. We have  also been listed in the 2020 list of The
    Best Speech Therapists in Singapore.

    Why home therapy?


    We believe in providing comprehensive speech therapy at our clients’
    convenience.

    A client’s home provides a more conducive environment for learning of new
    skills and/or generalization of new skills learnt into real life situations.
    Not forgetting, the home provides the most naturalistic environment to
    observe interaction between the client and their caregivers.

    We understand the needs and challenges of being a caregiver. Most caregivers
    are working thus sending your love one to the clinic for an appointment
    often result in taking leave or time off from work. This adds unnecessary
    stress to caregivers as not all employers will be as understanding towards
    the needs of being a caregiver.

    Some clients require intensive therapy sessions to optimize treatment
    results. However, frequent travelling to the clinic can be tiring for both
    the client and their caregiver(s).

    With the advancement of technology, we can instantly turn every home into a
    computerized speech and swallowing gym to carry out intensive speech and/or
    swallowing therapy. As such, we can bring the clinic to the clients' home!
