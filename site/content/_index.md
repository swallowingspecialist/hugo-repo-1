  heading: Why Speech Therapy Works?
  text: >-
    Speech Therapy Works is a community-based private practice serving clients
    across all ages especially families or individuals who have difficulty
    receiving therapy, or would benefit from having the therapist come to them.

    We aim to be the leading home based speech therapy provider offering
    high-quality personalized speech therapy to our clients in the comfort of
    their own homes.

    Our vast experience in both the private and public healthcare sector allows
    us to have a better understanding of Singapore’s overall healthcare system.

    We are able to reach out to the community across different language and
    dialect groups as we are proficient in English, Malay, Mandarin, Cantonese,
    Hokkien and Hainanese.

  heading: Our values

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
